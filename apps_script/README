The outklass-backend/ directory has code to process the glide-sheet queue.  That queue moves assignments from firebase to the Google spreadsheet, so the Glide no-code frontend app has access to the data.  (It doesn't work with firebase.)

The main directory has the code for a webapp that logs in a user and imports the user's data from Google Classroom.

To make the webapp, create a project at script.google.com, and cut & paste the code from these two files into your project.

You'll publish this code as a webapp via script.google.com .  Set it up to run as the user who visits the webapp's URL (not as the user who owns the code).  

When you go to the webapp's URL, it asks the user to log into Google Classroom and pulls the user's data into Firebase.

The idea is, when a new user joins the Outklass app, the frontend redirects them to this webapp to load the data, and then back to the app.  This way Google handles all the authentication.

It could use a prettier UI.

NOTE: I thought this was working when I ran it as myself, but it failed when I ran it as another user.  It may just be a permissions issue, or there may be an issue with the code.


You'll need to fill in this section with your own Firebase info
   var FIREBASE_URL = "FIREBASE_URL";
   var PRIVATE_KEY  = "FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY";
   var CLIENT_EMAIL = 'FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL';


It also has a function to update the user's classwork.
