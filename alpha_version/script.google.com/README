This is the original Outklass code; it should be working.  It puts data into a Google spreadsheet for use with a Glide frontend.

How to use it:  
1. go to this Google spreadsheet 
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wttJs-UoTqZsajJdqtgsJzPOanGZiz_ecJ_680vJ_EM/edit#gid=0
...copy it, and grab the copy's spreadsheet ID from the URL (the really long string of numbers & letters)
2. Go to script.google.com and log in with your child's school Google account.
3. Create a new project
4. copy the code into Code.gs and appsscript.json .  
   Edit Code.js to add your spreadsheet ID where it says 
   Edit code.js to add your twilio account SID in the two places where it says TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
   Edit code.js to add your twilio auth token in the two places where it says TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
   Edit code.js to add your twilio phone number where it says TWILIO_FROM_PHONE_NUMBER
5. Go to Edit > Current project's triggers
   Hit the 'Add Trigger' button and set it up to run two functions:
   * sendNotifications every 5 minutes
   * updateCourseworkSpreadsheet every 30 minutes
6. Go to Glide apps and build a frontend based on these screenshots (sorry, we can't find a way to share the frontend):

(We thought there was a way to save the frontend as a template in Glide so you could get started fast... but apparently that's not on the table.)


FUNCTIONS

hardRefreshCourseworkSpreadsheet -- 
   clear the entire coursework spreadsheet and re-fill it with ONLY THIS USER's latest info from Google Classroom
   this is just for testing, obviously

updateCourseworkSpreadsheet --
   update the user's coursework with the latest from Google Classroom
   it was run from EACH user's account every ~30 minutes

sendNotifications --
   check the Notifications sheet of the Google spreaadsheet, and send any notifications that are at or past the scheduled time
   we were running this every ~10 minutes to process the notifications
   it should only be run from ONE user's account
   the scheduled notifications were telling kids when assignments were coming due... apparently it was annoying.  you might want to drop that and do _only_ celebration messages... which are always sent ASAP




KNOWN BUGS:
* celebration notifications had a significant delay; they need to be immediate or close to it
* I seem to remember this having timezone issues
* This isn't a bug but the assignment reminders were super annoying; our kids hated them.  Also it gets expensive to sms so much
